# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




#Using ClassMap

Navigate to https://classmapreact.onrender.com/
Enter 'test@example.com' as the username
Enter 'testpassword' as the password
Hit the login button
The Hosting site for the API only spins up the API server when its in use, so the first time you login it may take a second, if you hit the login multiple times then it will tell you invalid credentials, be patient
once you login it should take you to the main page, where nothing happens.



#Running Locally

Don't, you need to have a local postgres server configured correctly.
